# ArtFlow Compilation Fixes

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Element.cs
- Corrected shape function derivative implementation
- Removed unnecessary xi parameter (derivatives are constant for linear elements)

### 2. Fixed FiniteElementSolver.cs
- Added `using System.Linq;` for LINQ operations
- Initialized matrix and vector fields properly to avoid null reference exceptions
- Added null checks in boundary condition methods
- Fixed GetGlobalNodeIndex logic
- Added bounds checking in CalculateAreaFromPressure to prevent negative areas

### 3. Fixed ElementAssembler.cs
- Completely rewrote the element matrix assembly logic
- Properly implemented the weak form integration
- Fixed matrix indexing for DOF assembly
- Corrected the Gauss quadrature implementation

### 4. Fixed ConfigLoader.cs
- Removed duplicate code that was causing compilation errors
- Properly structured the class with all methods

### 5. Project Structure
- All project references are correctly set up
- NuGet package references (MathNet.Numerics, Newtonsoft.Json) are properly configured
- All namespaces and using statements are correct

## Compilation Instructions

1. Ensure you have .NET 8.0 SDK installed
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd /Users/sspicer/work/ArtFlow`
3. Build the solution: `dotnet build`
4. Run the example: `dotnet run --project ArtFlow.Console run examples/carotid_test.json`

## Key Implementation Features

### Numerical Method
- Space-time finite element method
- Discontinuous Galerkin in time (piecewise constant)
- Continuous piecewise linear elements in space
- 2-point Gauss quadrature for integration
- Modified Newton-Raphson for nonlinear system

### Physical Model
- 1D blood flow equations in quasi-linear form
- Olufsen's constitutive model for arterial elasticity
- Poiseuille velocity profile (n=2)
- Support for stenosis modeling (Seeley-Young formula)

### Boundary Conditions
- Prescribed flow rate (Dirichlet on Q)
- Prescribed pressure (converted to Dirichlet on S)
- Resistance boundary condition (p - QR = 0)

### Software Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns across projects
- Extensible boundary condition system
- JSON-based configuration
- Console application for easy execution

The implementation now compiles without errors and provides a solid foundation for 1D cardiovascular flow simulation.
